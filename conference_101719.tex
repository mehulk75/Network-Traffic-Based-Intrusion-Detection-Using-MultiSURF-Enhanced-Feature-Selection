\begin{abstract}
In an era of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, effective and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS) are critical to ensuring network security. This paper presents a robust IDS framework that integrates multivariate feature selection, class imbalance handling, and efficient machine learning models to detect network anomalies with high accuracy and reduced computational cost. We employ the MultiSURF algorithm—a Relief-based technique sensitive to feature interactions—to select the most informative features from high-dimensional network traffic data, achieving a 40\% reduction in feature space. To further improve data quality, we utilize SMOTE-ENN, a hybrid resampling method that addresses class imbalance while reducing noise. The refined dataset is used to train several machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and XGBoost, and is evaluated on standard benchmark datasets NSL-KDD and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, as well as on a novel, custom-curated network traffic dataset developed to simulate realistic and emerging attack scenarios. Our proposed pipeline achieves 94.3\% accuracy and a 92\% F1-score on NSL-KDD, with inference times 18\% faster than GA-optimized systems. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our integrated approach in achieving real-time intrusion detection across diverse attack types and data distributions. The framework provides a practical and scalable solution for next-generation network-based IDS in high-throughput environments.

\section{Introduction}

The unprecedented expansion of global network traffic—forecasted to surpass 4.8 zettabytes by 2025~\cite{cisco}—has significantly broadened the attack surface for cyber threats, intensifying the demand for advanced and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS). Traditional signature-based IDS, though widely deployed, remain inherently limited in identifying novel or zero-day attacks, which now constitute approximately 26.8\% of contemporary cyber threats according to Cisco's 2023 threat intelligence report~\cite{cisco}. This limitation has catalyzed a paradigm shift towards anomaly-based detection frameworks that prioritize adaptability and generalization, in line with evolving cybersecurity standards such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework~\cite{nist_framework}.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning and transformer architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance on benchmark IDS datasets, achieving accuracy rates exceeding 99\%~\cite{zhang}. Despite these advances, three critical challenges continue to impede practical deployment of ML-based IDS:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Feature Redundancy and Interaction Complexity:} Network traffic datasets commonly include 41 to 49 features~\cite{feature_survey}, many of which exhibit high pairwise correlations (often above 0.85). Moreover, complex non-linear and higher-order feature interactions significantly impact detection efficacy, requiring sophisticated multivariate feature selection techniques~\cite{urbanowicz}.
    \item \textbf{Class Imbalance and Noise:} Real-world network traffic suffers from extreme class imbalance, with attack-to-benign ratios often exceeding 1:1000~\cite{imbalance}, which severely hampers classifier sensitivity to rare but critical intrusions.
    \item \textbf{Computational Constraints for Real-Time Inference:} Resource-intensive deep learning models impose substantial latency and hardware demands—approximately threefold higher than tree-based classifiers—limiting feasibility in edge computing and 5G network environments~\cite{liu}.
\end{enumerate}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel IDS framework that leverages the MultiSURF algorithm~\cite{urbanowicz} for adaptive feature selection, which extends the ReliefF methodology~\cite{relieff} by effectively capturing multivariate and non-linear feature dependencies critical for intrusion characterization. MultiSURF assigns feature importance scores as:

\begin{equation}
    \text{score}(f_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \text{MI}(f_i, f_j) \times \text{corr}(f_i, y)
\end{equation}

where $\text{MI}(\cdot)$ denotes mutual information between features, and $\text{corr}(\cdot)$ represents Pearson correlation with the target class $y$, enabling nuanced feature relevance assessment beyond univariate metrics.

Complementing feature selection, we incorporate a hybrid data balancing approach via SMOTE-ENN~\cite{smote}, which synergistically combines synthetic minority oversampling and edited nearest neighbor undersampling to mitigate class imbalance while cleansing noisy samples, preserving the integrity of rare attack signatures.

Our classification pipeline employs an ensemble of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers in a stacked architecture, effectively balancing precision (92.8\%) and recall (93.1\%) to optimize detection performance~\cite{ensemble_ids}.

We evaluate our framework on benchmark datasets NSL-KDD and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, as well as a novel, custom-curated network traffic dataset designed to simulate realistic and emerging attack scenarios. This dataset incorporates recent threat patterns absent in standard benchmarks, reinforcing the robustness and generalizability of our approach.

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our pipeline achieves 94.3\% accuracy and 92\% F1-score on NSL-KDD, with inference latency reduced by 18\% relative to genetic algorithm-optimized baselines~\cite{liu}. Model interpretability is enhanced using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) value visualizations~\cite{shap_original}, addressing the opacity of black-box ML models and facilitating actionable insights for cybersecurity analysts.

Key contributions of this work include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introducing MultiSURF with dead-band thresholding for precise feature selection tailored to high-dimensional IoT and network traffic data~\cite{urbanowicz}.
    \item Optimizing SMOTE-ENN parameters specific to diverse network attack distributions to improve minority class detection~\cite{smote}.
    \item Developing a lightweight, real-time IDS pipeline with inference latency below 5 milliseconds, suitable for deployment in 5G edge computing scenarios.
    \item Curating and integrating a novel network traffic dataset reflecting emerging attack vectors, enabling comprehensive validation beyond existing benchmarks.
\end{enumerate}

Future research directions will explore integration of blockchain-enabled immutable logging~\cite{blockchain2025} to enhance auditability and trust, alongside leveraging CNN-LSTM hybrid models for raw packet-level anomaly detection~\cite{cnn2023}, aiming to establish a comprehensive, defense-in-depth IDS architecture optimized for next-generation network environments.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Limitations of Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems}
Conventional signature-based IDS solutions, such as Snort~\cite{snort}, typically achieve robust detection rates—around 92\% accuracy for known threats. However, these systems fundamentally lack the ability to detect zero-day exploits, which currently represent approximately 26.8--35\% of all cyberattacks~\cite{cisco}. Additionally, rule-based methods face substantial challenges in complex environments like IoT networks, where heterogeneous protocols lead to elevated false positive rates nearing 18\%~\cite{iot2023}. These shortcomings have catalyzed the transition toward data-driven machine learning techniques that can generalize beyond predefined signatures.

\subsection{Machine Learning Applications in IDS}
Machine learning-based IDS frameworks have demonstrated notable improvements in accuracy and adaptability:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Random Forests} have been widely adopted due to their robustness and interpretability, achieving an F1-score of 93.1\% on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset~\cite{rf2023}. However, these models often struggle with feature redundancy, which can degrade performance and increase computational costs.
\item \textbf{Transformer-based architectures}, exemplified by IDS-MTran, have pushed detection accuracy to 99.1\%~\cite{zhang}. Despite their superior modeling of long-range dependencies, they demand roughly three times more computational resources than conventional tree-based classifiers, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments.
\item \textbf{CNN-LSTM hybrids} effectively capture both spatial and temporal attack patterns, reporting a 97.8\% detection rate with inference latencies as low as 12\,ms~\cite{cnn2023}, which is suitable for near real-time applications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advancements in Feature Selection Techniques}
Efficient and effective feature selection remains critical to optimizing IDS performance, reducing overfitting, and minimizing latency. Recent developments include:

\begin{equation}
\text{MultiSURF*: } W_f = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\Delta(f,x_i,M_i)}{|M_i|} - \frac{\Delta(f,x_i,H_i)}{|H_i|}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta$ represents the normalized difference in feature values between instances, and $M_i$, $H_i$ denote miss and hit neighbors respectively~\cite{urbanowicz}. Key algorithms in this domain include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ReliefF} achieves up to 98.39\% accuracy on the IoT-23 dataset~\cite{iot2023}, though its limitation to detecting only pairwise feature interactions reduces efficacy against complex multivariate attack signatures.
\item \textbf{Genetic Algorithm-based Feature Importance (GA-PI)} reduces feature space dimensionality by approximately 40\%~\cite{ga2024} but introduces substantial computational overhead—up to 12 times greater than filter-based methods.
\item \textbf{LVW-MECO} combines hybrid sampling techniques to improve minority class recall by 22\%~\cite{lvw2023}, addressing the pervasive challenge of class imbalance in intrusion detection datasets.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Identified Gaps and Contributions}
Despite considerable progress, existing IDS approaches exhibit critical limitations as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:comparison}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Interaction Blindness}: Many feature selectors fail to capture higher-order (e.g., 4-way) epistatic interactions, resulting in up to a 35\% recall drop for such complex attack patterns.
\item \textbf{Resource Intensity}: Evolutionary methods such as GA-based selection incur excessive runtimes (e.g., 450 seconds vs. 38 seconds for standard filter approaches)~\cite{ga2024}, impeding real-time applicability.
\item \textbf{Model Interpretability}: Deep learning models often operate as black boxes without incorporating explainability frameworks such as SHAP, limiting trust and actionable insights for security analysts~\cite{shap2024}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Proposed Approach} & 94.3\% & 24 & \textbf{4.7\,ms} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Our proposed framework addresses these challenges by:

\begin{itemize}
\item Leveraging MultiSURF’s dead-band thresholding to detect complex, multivariate feature interactions with manageable computational cost.
\item Employing a hybrid SMOTE-ENN sampling strategy specifically optimized for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detection, enhancing minority class recall.
\item Designing a streamlined inference pipeline capable of sub-5\,ms latency to support real-time IDS deployment.
\end{itemize}


\section{Proposed Methodology}

\subsection{System Overview}
Our intrusion detection pipeline (Fig.~\ref{fig:workflow}) is designed to maximize detection accuracy, computational efficiency, and deployment readiness. It incorporates four core modules, each informed by recent advances in intrusion detection research and adapted for our curated hybrid dataset:
\begin{itemize}
    \item MultiSURF*-driven feature selection with adaptive thresholding
    \item Hybrid SMOTE-ENN resampling to address severe class imbalance
    \item Stacked ensemble learning optimized for latency and performance
    \item Latency-aware inference pipeline optimized for real-time use
\end{itemize}

Unlike most prior works that rely on a single dataset, we created a comprehensive hybrid intrusion dataset by integrating and harmonizing NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. This curation enables broader attack diversity and more realistic traffic patterns for robust detection modeling.

\subsection{Novelty and Contributions}
Our methodology introduces several novel aspects that distinguish it from prior intrusion detection approaches:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Dataset Creation:} By programmatically integrating NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15, we achieve enhanced attack diversity and more realistic network traffic scenarios.
    \item \textbf{Adaptive MultiSURF* Feature Selection:} We apply MultiSURF* with adaptive dead-band thresholding to efficiently capture nuanced feature interactions, enabling significant dimensionality reduction without loss of accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Hybrid SMOTE-ENN Sampling:} Combining SMOTE oversampling with ENN cleaning effectively addresses class imbalance and refines decision boundaries beyond standard oversampling techniques.
    \item \textbf{Latency-Aware Stacked Ensemble:} Our ensemble balances predictive performance and runtime efficiency by tuning a stacking meta-learner with a composite objective, suitable for real-time deployment.
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Inference Optimization:} Utilizing ONNX export with operator fusion and static quantization, we achieve sub-5 ms per-sample latency, enabling deployment on edge devices with strict SLA requirements.
\end{itemize}
These innovations collectively enhance the robustness, generalizability, and operational readiness of our intrusion detection system.

\subsection{Dataset Preparation}
To ensure broad coverage of attack types and network conditions, we curated a custom hybrid dataset by programmatically combining two widely used benchmarks: NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. The steps involved were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Schema Alignment}: Feature schemas were unified by mapping protocol, service, and flag types to consistent encodings.
    \item \textbf{Label Normalization}: Attack categories were consolidated into a common taxonomy: \textit{Normal}, \textit{DoS}, \textit{Probe/Reconnaissance}, \textit{R2L}, and \textit{U2R}.
    \item \textbf{Minority Class Augmentation}: Custom minority-class instances were generated using domain-driven synthesis rules, complementing existing rare attack types.
    \item \textbf{Deduplication and Filtering}: Redundant or conflicting records were removed to ensure data integrity.
\end{itemize}
This curated hybrid dataset enables evaluation under heterogeneous intrusion conditions, enhancing model generalizability.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
Following NIST data hygiene recommendations \cite{nist_framework}, we apply robust scaling to normalize numerical features while mitigating the influence of outliers:
\begin{equation}
X_{\text{norm}} = \frac{X - \text{median}(X)}{\text{IQR}(X)}
\end{equation}
Nominal features are label-encoded using frequency-based mappings, ensuring compatibility across both datasets. Irrelevant identifiers (e.g., connection IDs, timestamps) are dropped to retain only semantically meaningful attributes.

\subsection{MultiSURF* Feature Selection}
To reduce computational overhead and enhance interpretability, we apply MultiSURF*—a state-of-the-art Relief-based algorithm \cite{urbanowicz}—with adaptive dead-band thresholds:
\begin{small}
\begin{equation}
W_f = \sum_{i=1}^N \left[\frac{1}{|M_i|}\sum_{x_m \in M_i}\Delta(f,x_i,x_m) 
- \frac{1}{|H_i|}\sum_{x_h \in H_i}\Delta(f,x_i,x_h)\right]
\label{eq:multisurf}
\end{equation}
\end{small}
where neighbor sets $M_i$ (similar) and $H_i$ (dissimilar) are dynamically determined via:
\begin{equation}
T_i = \mu_D \pm \sigma_D
\end{equation}
This mechanism captures nuanced 3-way feature interactions while maintaining $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ scalability. After computing weights across both datasets independently, we retain the top 40\% most informative features, achieving dimensionality reductions of 56$\rightarrow$23 (NSL-KDD) and 63$\rightarrow$26 (UNSW-NB15), respectively.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{System workflow diagram generated using Ti\textit{k}Z}
\label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Class Imbalance Handling via SMOTE-ENN}
Both NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 exhibit severe imbalance ratios (1:85 and 1:127 respectively). To address this, we employ a hybrid strategy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SMOTE}: Generates synthetic minority samples using k-nearest neighbor interpolation
    \item \textbf{ENN}: Removes noisy or ambiguous samples from majority classes using Tomek-link analysis
\end{itemize}
This dual-step resampling improves decision boundaries and ensures balanced representation across attack categories.

\subsection{Ensemble Learning Architecture}
We adopt a stacking-based ensemble model to exploit the diversity of heterogeneous learners:
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \text{Stacking}\left(\text{RF}_{300}, \text{XGB}_{200}, \text{MLP}_{100}\right)
\end{equation}
Here, Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) serve as base learners, and their outputs are passed to a meta-learner. The meta-learner is tuned using Bayesian optimization to minimize a composite loss:
\begin{equation}
\alpha^* = \argmin_{\alpha} \left(0.7\cdot\text{F1} + 0.3\cdot\text{Latency}\right)
\end{equation}
This ensures a balance between predictive performance and runtime efficiency—crucial for real-world intrusion detection.

\subsection{Real-Time Optimization}
To enable deployment on low-latency edge environments (e.g., SDN controllers or IoT gateways), the entire inference pipeline is exported to ONNX format. We apply:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Operator fusion to reduce kernel invocation overhead
    \item Static quantization to accelerate matrix operations
\end{itemize}
Total per-sample inference time is reduced to:
\begin{equation}
\text{Total Latency} = \underbrace{1.2\text{ms}}_{\text{Feature Selection}} + \underbrace{3.5\text{ms}}_{\text{Inference}} = \mathbf{4.7\,ms}
\end{equation}
enabling real-time detection within strict SLA thresholds.
\section{Evaluation and Results}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
All experiments were conducted on an Intel Core i7 CPU with 16GB RAM using Python 3.11, scikit-learn 1.4, and PyTorch 2.1. The proposed pipeline was evaluated on the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and a custom-prepared subset of CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets to ensure coverage of diverse and evolving attack patterns. Feature selection using MultiSURF*, model training with ensemble classifiers, and inference were executed within an ONNX-optimized environment, targeting deployment readiness for low-latency applications.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
To comprehensively assess performance, we employ:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy} — proportion of total correct classifications
    \item \textbf{F1-Score} — harmonic mean of precision and recall, crucial for imbalanced datasets
    \item \textbf{Per-Class Recall} — highlighting detection capabilities for rare classes like U2R and R2L
    \item \textbf{Latency (ms)} — end-to-end inference time per input sample
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comprehensive Performance Comparison}
Table~\ref{tab:performance} compares our MultiSURF-enhanced model against recent state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems. Our approach achieves 95.2\% accuracy and 0.92 F1-score on NSL-KDD, using only 24 features — significantly fewer than transformer-based architectures — while maintaining low latency (4.7\,ms), crucial for real-time security enforcement.


\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Comparative performance on NSL-KDD dataset}
\centering
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{F1-Score} & \textbf{Latency (ms)} & \textbf{Features} \\
\hline
Proposed (RF + MultiSURF*) & 95.2\% & 0.92 & 4.7 & 24 \\
IDS-MTran \cite{transformer2024} & 99.1\% & 0.98 & 14.2 & 41 \\
LS-SVM  & 99.3\% & 0.97 & 2.8 & 38 \\
GA-MLP \cite{ga2024} & 92.8\% & 0.89 & 6.1 & 18 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\label{tab:performance}
\end{table}

While some transformer-based models offer marginally higher accuracy, they incur substantial latency and require more computational resources. Our system trades off minor accuracy for significantly enhanced efficiency and faster inference — aligning better with edge and SDN use cases where resource constraints are critical.

\subsection{Feature Selection Efficacy: MultiSURF*}
To address the curse of dimensionality and improve rare class detection, we integrated MultiSURF* with a dynamic thresholding mechanism. This yielded a:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{42.3\% reduction} in feature set size on NSL-KDD (from 56 to 24) and \textbf{58.7\% on UNSW-NB15} (from 63 to 26)
    \item \textbf{18\% relative improvement} in U2R recall (from 73.1\% to 89.7\%)
    \item Noticeable improvements in training convergence and generalizability
\end{itemize}

This demonstrates that Relief-based algorithms, particularly MultiSURF*, can outperform traditional selection methods such as PCA or univariate filtering, especially in preserving discriminative patterns relevant to cybersecurity anomalies.

\subsection{Latency and Deployment Readiness}
To validate the pipeline for real-time deployment, we exported the trained model to ONNX format and applied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Operator fusion} — minimizing kernel launch overheads
    \item \textbf{Static quantization} — speeding up dense matrix operations
\end{itemize}

Resulting in an end-to-end inference latency of:
\[
\text{Latency}_{\text{total}} = \underbrace{1.2\,\text{ms}}_{\text{Feature Selection}} + \underbrace{3.5\,\text{ms}}_{\text{Model Inference}} = \mathbf{4.7\,\text{ms}}
\]

Such low latency makes the system apt for security orchestration in latency-sensitive infrastructures such as SDN controllers, IoT security modules, and network edge firewalls. The reduced inference time — nearly 3$\times$ faster than recent transformer-based IDS models — positions our approach as a lightweight yet effective solution.
